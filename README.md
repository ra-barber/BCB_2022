# Biodiversty and Conservation Biology teaching materials #

This repository contains code to host and manage a github pages site for the Biodiversity and Conservation Biology Course at Imperial College London. The notebooks with practical materials are created using Jupyter Books (v1), which has now been upgraded. Consequently, some formatting issues exist using older versions of Sphinx, particuarly when using the dark mode theme.
