## Useful links

Below are some useful links mentioned in the practicals, as well as a couple more that may be of use.

### Data sources
Bird tree, where you can download your own phylogenetic trees, using the Jetz taxonomy we've used in this course.  
<http://birdtree.org/>

The birdlife datazone, where you can download species lists for a protected area, national park, or country.  
<http://datazone.birdlife.org/home>

### Tidyverse

The main tidyverse page for finding out more about coding the tidy way!  
<https://www.tidyverse.org/>

### Plotting trees

The interactive tree of life website, we can be useful for visualising your tree.  
<https://itol.embl.de/>

A guide to using ggtree, including adding extra labels, highlighting clades, and adding images.  
<https://4va.github.io/biodatasci/r-ggtree.html#the_ggtree_package>

<https://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/chapter10.html>

The R cookbook. This has a really useful section on plotting with ggplot2, and how to change colours, add labels, etc.  
<http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/>

### Using a PGLS

A useful paper aimed at beginners introducing the lambda value, by Natlie Cooper at the Natural History Museum.  
<https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0341>

Chapter 5 of modern phylogenetic comparative methods, assumptions of a PGLS. I'd suggest reading chapter 5 before 6, as chapter 5 has more maths that isn't strictly needed to understand a PGLS.  
<http://www.mpcm-evolution.com/book-sections/part-introduction/6-statistical-issues-assumptions-phylogenetic-generalised-least-squares>

Chapter 5 of modern phylogenetic comparative methods, an introduction to a PGLS. Both chapters can be found on researchgate, or using scihub.  
<http://www.mpcm-evolution.com/book-sections/part-introduction/5-primer-phylogenetic-generalised-least-squares>

A useful paper by Rob Freckleton, called the seven deadly sins of comparative analysis. This paper helps build understanding of a PGLS, but is really extra reading for anyone really interested.  
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01757.x>

### Spatial analysis

The specific page of the birdlife datazone that tells you what the different codes for ranges mean.  
<http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/spcdistPOS>

The github page for using the sf package. There's a cheatsheet, and in the articles tab you can see guides for spatial data handling using sf.  
<https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html>

A really useful guide on spatial analysis using R (and other things), aimed at ecologists! Cannot recommend highly enough!  
<https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html>

### EDGE Scores

The EDGE programme at ZSL.  
<https://www.zsl.org/conservation/our-priorities/wildlife-back-from-the-brink/animals-on-the-edge>

The paper that first proposed EcoEDGE scores.  
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12320>
